# OS-Ex4
OS Course Ex4 - Implementing Local &amp; TCP Thread Safe Stack

Recycled some of old code from OS Assignments.
The shell is based on Shell assignment,
The Server & Client is based on Multi-threaded TCP Server (+Its client).

# Makefile:


## Local Stack & Shell
`make local`

## Server &  Client (Multi threaded)
Server:
`make server`


Client:
`make client`


# Usage:

## Local
`./local`


## Server & Client
Start the server using `./server`

Then, create client instance using `./client <IP>` where by default (as the server is currently hard coded) you may use 127.0.0.1 as IP.
